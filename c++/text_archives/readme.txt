-> These codes are a mere practice of my own.
   The project it's just a proof of concept and
   my own knowledge of the language and basic
   data structures and use of text archives, so it's not perfect.

   The program uses a binary tree that contains seven tester nodes,
   it will create the necesary files if the archives *.txt doesn exists
   in the designates directory. 
   Otherwise, it will read the designated files and will create a new binary tree
   and will continue a normal execution. 

    These codes works with archives *.txt
    Feel free to read, analyze and improve them if you wish.

    If you want to compile them in your computer, you can use the next command:

    Compiles in Linux (Mint):

       g++ -D others -std=c++11 -o linkedLists *.cpp
