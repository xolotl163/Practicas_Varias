-> These codes are a mere practice of my own.
   The project it's just a proof of concept and
   my own knowledge of the language and basic
   data structures, so it's not perfect.

   These are 4 basic data structures:
    - Stack
    - Queue
    - Linked List
    - Binary Tree

    These codes work without archives like *.txt, *.csv, *.json, etc.
    Feel free to read, analyze and improve them if you wish.

    If you want to compile them in your computer, you can use the next commands:

    Compiles in Linux (Mint) stack queue and linked list:
       g++ -D others -std=c++11 -o dataStructures main.cpp  source_code/*.cpp 

    Compiles in Linux (Mint) binary tree:
        g++ -D binarytree -std=c++11 -o binaryTree main source_code/*.cpp
